## **LootCollector Changelog: Version 0.5.1S (from 0.4.9)**

Changes focusing on database optimization, network protocol enhancements, community moderation, and  UI/UX and QOL improvements.

### **Major New Features & Architectural Changes**

*   **Database Schema v6 Overhaul & Migration:**   
    *   A new automated, one-time **Database Migration** system prompts users with older databases. It safely preserves all character-specific "looted" history while upgrading the main discovery database to the new format and automatically importing the latest starter database.

*   **Map Clustering & Zone Awareness:**
    *   When viewing a continent or parent zone (e.g., Kalimdor), discoveries are now grouped into a single "cluster" pin at the zone's entrance, showing the total count. (implemented just not applied except Mulgore)
    *   Clicking a cluster pin zooms into that zone, decluttering the world view and improving performance.

*   **Advanced Toast Notification System:**
    *   **Anti-Spam Ticker:** When many discoveries are received at once, the addon switches from individual pop-ups to a single, scrolling "ticker" frame to prevent UI spam. (can be disabled)
    *   **Smart Queue & Spam Detection:** The system now detects and suppresses toast spam from individual players to maintain a clean user experience.
    *   **Interactivity:** Toasts are now interactive. Move mouse pointer over an item to see details or Shift+click to opens map and focus on its location.

*   **Community Moderation & Data Integrity:**
    *   **"Report as Gone":** Right-clicking a map pin and reporting it as gone now sends a "deletion vote" to the network.
    *   **Status by Consensus:** If enough players report a discovery as gone, its status is automatically downgraded to `FADING` and then `STALE`, keeping the database clean. `STALE` items are visually distinct on the map.
    *   **Coordinate Consensus:** The system refines a discovery's coordinates over time by averaging reports from multiple players, improving pin accuracy.

*   **"Show to..." a Player Feature:**
    *   You can now right-click a map pin to select "Show to...". This allows you to send a specific discovery location directly to another player and focus his map on it.
    *   The recipient gets a confirmation popup to "Allow," "Deny," or "Block Sender," preventing unsolicited map pings.

### **Communication & Network**

*   **New v5 Network Protocol:** The communication system has been rewritten for efficiency, supporting new features like deletion votes (`ACK`), data corrections, and "Show" requests.
*   **Advanced Rate Limiting:** A "leaky bucket" algorithm has been implemented for channel messages. This smooths out network traffic to prevent disconnects and ensures no messages are dropped during busy periods.
*   **Enhanced Security & Validation:**
    *   Incoming messages are now strictly validated for correct data types and ranges. Invalid messages are tracked, and repeat offenders are automatically session-ignored or permanently blacklisted.
*   **Version Enforcement:** The addon now enforces a minimum compatible version, ignoring messages from outdated clients to prevent data corruption.
*   **Important Change to Sharing:** To ensure data quality, automatic sharing is temporarily limited to **Worldforged** items. Mystic Scrolls can still be shared manually via `/lcshare` and the "Show to..." feature. Default automatic sharing for MS will be restored in future versions.


### **UI & Quality of Life Improvements**

*   **Map Enhancements:**
    *   **Search & Filter Bar:** An optional search bar can now be displayed on the World Map to filter pins by item or zone name in real-time.
    *   **Map Focus Animation:** A new "Focus" feature (accessible via Shift+click) opens the map and plays a pulsing animation at a discovery's location.
    *   **Improved Pin Appearance:** Pin borders are now color-coded by item quality. `STALE` items are clearly marked with a distinct orange color.

*   **Arrow (TomTom) Improvements:**
    *   A new "Auto-track Nearest Unlooted" option automatically activates the arrow.
    *   You can now temporarily "skip" the nearest target for the current session via the map filter menu.
    *   The arrow now automatically finds the next target after you loot the one it was pointing to.

*   **Minimap Overhaul:**
	*   Dynamic minimap shape detection to display markers along the edges correctly has been implemented based on **Markosz** code.
	*   A new option allows limiting minimap pins to a specific yardage from your character.
    *   The minimap pin logic has been completely rewritten for accuracy and performance.    

*   **Advanced Filtering:**
    *   Filters for discoveries now include "Usable by Class" and "Equipment Slot," which work instantly even for uncached items.

*   **Import/Export:**
    *   Added a new **"Import from File"** method for safely importing massive community databases without freezing the client.
    *   Player block/whitelists can now be included in exports.
    *   Added a **"Factory Reset"** button to the Discoveries panel to completely wipe all addon data.

### **Core Logic & Bug Fixes**

*   **Centralized Zone Data:** A new `ZoneList.lua` module provides accurate Zone, Instance, and Sub-zone name resolution, which is critical for map clustering and display accuracy.
*   **Item Metadata Storage:** The addon now stores more metadata for each discovery (item type, subtype, class restrictions) directly in the database.
*   **Delayed Broadcasting:** Newly found discoveries are now briefly buffered. This allows the client to cache item information, ensuring more complete and accurate data is broadcast to other players.
*   **Coordinate Precision:** All coordinates now use 4-decimal precision for improved accuracy.
*   **Fixed `/1` Hijacking:** Resolved an issue where the addon could sometimes interfere with the official chat channels.
